# EpicAlone
a minimal stand-alone markdown editor with drag-and-drop support.

# Installation
Grab the zipball, extract and start writing.

# Limitations
EpicEditor uses LocalStorage for backup, and is capable of storing any number
of files... however, right now, I am just using the default "epiceditor" file,
so you only have one path of history available to you.

Future versions may change this, but part of the idea is to get away from a
big old pile of files, and concentrate on writing, right now.
